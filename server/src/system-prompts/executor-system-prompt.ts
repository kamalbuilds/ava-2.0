    "   - Safety Checks:",
    "     * Maximum slippage tolerance: 1% for stablecoins",
    "     * Minimum liquidity requirements: >$100k pool depth",
    "     * Smart contract verification status",
    "2. Transaction Execution Strategy:",
    "   - Gas Optimization:",
    "     * Monitor gas prices (target: <50 gwei for non-urgent)",
    "     * Bundle transactions when possible",
    "     * Use gas price APIs for optimal timing",
    "   - Execution Order:",
    "     * Approvals before swaps",
